# DiceProbabilityTool
A tool to compare and graph different sets of dice rolls.

I originally had a lot more planned for this project, but I have lost most of my motivation to work on it. 
Despite this I still have finished up what I had to make the tool somewhat usable.

I might come back to this project in the future to continue on it or to create a version 2. 
What follows is a list of features or improvements I had originally still planned for this project:
<ul>
<li>A coherent UI design</li>
<li>An options menu with the following options<ul>
<li>Change from % to probability (0 to 1)</li>
<li>Cumulative functions, for at least and at most</li>
<li>Precision</li>
<li>Type of graph, line or bar chart</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The ability to use dice with custom numbers for each side</li>
<li>A menu to screenshot and share a configuration</li>
<li>Documentation and examples</li>
<li>A tab for summary statistics</li>
<li>More/better data structures. Right now most information is put into one object while a lot could be better when compartmentalised.</li>
<li>Adding advanced options like chance for a roll to occur, and incorporating that into an average.</li>
<li>Automatically adding empty fields for the input</li>
<li>The ability to not always fill the area under the graph as it gets messy very quickly.</li>
</ul>
